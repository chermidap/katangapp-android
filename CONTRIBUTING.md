## Blank lines
Adding blank lines in between code adds clarity. Let's use the criteria that if two lines can be interchangeable, then
can be joined. Otherwise, let's separate with a blank line.

Let's use one blank line between methods, one blank line after class declaration,Â and one blank line before
class-closing curly brackets.

### File endings
Do not add a blank line after the last line with content.

### Empty methods
Do not add a blank line in an empty method.

### Method endings
There won't be a blank line before method endings.

## Indent
The unit to define an indent will be four spaces. Use a unit after each inner block.

## Order of methods in a class
Use alphabetical order to define the methods in a class. This will increase speed when searching for them.

## Organize imports
Separate imports with a blank line on those ones differing their second package names.
